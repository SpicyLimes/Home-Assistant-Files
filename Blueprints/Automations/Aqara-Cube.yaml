  author: "SpicyLimes (Remix of SirGoodenough)"
  description: >
    Automate actions for the Aqara Cube T1 Pro using ZHA. Assign scripts to specific cube actions (slide, double-tap, rotate, flip, shake). Actions are grouped by specific side or any side. Most actions can trigger multiple groups; use only one group to avoid double automation triggers. "Drop" is not supported on the Cube T1 Pro.

    For troubleshooting, a diagnostic event is fired with the last action. To show the last action, create a template sensor for the "zha_cube_last_action" event.
